Write a shell script that performs the following function:

Takes exactly two parameters and gives an error if there are more or less than that
Checks to see if there is a file in the current directory with the name given as the first parameter and tells the user if this is the case
Checks to see if there is a directory in the current directory with the name given as the second parameter and tells the user if this is the case
Please submit your script file via BlackBoard file upload on this assignment



#!/bin/bash

# Check the number of parameters
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Error: Please provide exactly two parameters."
    exit 1
fi

# Extract parameters
file_name=$1
dir_name=$2

# Check if a file with the given name exists
if [ -e "$file_name" ]; then
    echo "A file with the name '$file_name' exists in the current directory."
else
    echo "No file found with the name '$file_name' in the current directory."
fi

# Check if a directory with the given name exists
if [ -d "$dir_name" ]; then
    echo "A directory with the name '$dir_name' exists in the current directory."
else
    echo "No directory found with the name '$dir_name' in the current directory."
fi

chmod +x check_files.sh

./check_files.sh filename directoryname
